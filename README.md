# Loan_Eligibility_Project
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict home loan eligibility using applicant data. The dataset includes key financial and demographic features such as income, loan amount, credit history, and employment status, which influence loan approval decisions. The first step involves data acquisition and preparation, where the dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded to ensure the data is in a suitable format for machine learning. Additionally, feature engineering techniques, such as calculating the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and standardizing numerical values, help enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power.

The project utilizes logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm, to determine loan approval outcomes. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, the model is trained using Scikit-learn and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Techniques such as hyperparameter tuning are applied to improve performance further. Additionally, alternative models like decision trees and random forests are considered to compare predictive accuracy and optimize results.
